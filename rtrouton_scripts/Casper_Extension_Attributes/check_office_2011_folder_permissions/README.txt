This Casper Extension Attribute checks the permissions of the /Applications/Microsoft Office 2011 folder to see if they are correctly set to the following permissions:

Owner: read/write/execute permissions
Group: read/write/execute permissions
Everyone: read/execute permissions

If the permissions are set correctly, the script returns "Yes" If the permissions are set to some other combination, the script returns "No".

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
