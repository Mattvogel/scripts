This Casper Extension Attribute checks to see if the Dell KACE KBox 1000 Mac agent is installed. If installed, the agent version is returned. If the agent is not installed, the script returns "Not Installed".

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
