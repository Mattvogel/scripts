This Casper Extension Attribute checks 10.5 and 10.6 Macs to see if their Active Directory machine password interval is set to 0. If it's set to 0, that means that the machine password will never update.

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
