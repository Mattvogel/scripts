This Casper Extension Attribute uses the diskutil list command to check for disk partitions reporting as "Microsoft Basic Data".

If Microsoft Basic Data partition is reported by diskutil, script reports "Yes". If no Microsoft Basic Data partition is reported by diskutil, script reports "No".

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
