This Casper Extension Attribute checks 10.7 and 10.8 Macs to see if Gatekeeper is disabled. If Gatekeeper is disabled, script returns "Disabled". Any other status will result in script returning "Active".

See "Casper_Extension_Attribute_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Extension Attribute should be configured.
