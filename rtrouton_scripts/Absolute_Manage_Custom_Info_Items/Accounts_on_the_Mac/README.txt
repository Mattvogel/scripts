This Absolute Manage custom information item checks the /Users folder on the AM-managed client Mac. All user home folders are listed. To avoid listing non-user folders, the "Deleted Users" and "Shared" folders are excluded from the search.

See "Absolute_Manage_Custom_Info_Item_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Custom Information Item should be configured.
