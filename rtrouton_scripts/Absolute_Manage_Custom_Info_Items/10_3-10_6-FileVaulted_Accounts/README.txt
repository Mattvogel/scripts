This Absolute Manage custom information item checks the /Users folder on the AM-managed client Mac. All user home folders encrypted with FileVault are listed. To avoid listing non-user folders, the "Shared" folder is excluded from the search.

See "Absolute_Manage_Custom_Info_Item_Setup.png" for a screenshot of how the Custom Information Item should be configured.

Note: This Custom Information Item will work correctly only on 10.3.x - 10.6.x encrypted Macs.
